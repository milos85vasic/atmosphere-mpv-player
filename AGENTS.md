# AGENTS.md — mpv-player submodule (ATMOSphere 1.1.3-dev-0.0.6+)

Every AI agent working in this submodule MUST comply with the canonical
[ATMOSphere Constitution](../../../../../docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md)
in the parent repo.

## Non-negotiable summary

1. **Tests for every change**: pre-build `CM-MC*` gate, post-build gate,
   on-device test, and a mutation entry in
   `scripts/testing/meta_test_false_positive_proof.sh` proving the gate
   catches regressions.
2. **Both devices flashed and green** before any tag.
3. **Commit + push via `bash scripts/commit_all.sh "…"` from the
   parent repo root.** For submodule source changes: commit inside the
   submodule first, push to every submodule remote, THEN run parent's
   `commit_all.sh` to capture the updated pointer.
4. **Tags cascade**: every main-repo tag mirrored on this submodule at
   its current HEAD, across every remote this submodule publishes to.
   Use `scripts/testing/release_tag.sh <tag>` from the parent.
5. **Changelog discipline**: every tag has `docs/changelogs/<tag>.md`
   + HTML + JSON + TXT exports (`scripts/testing/export_changelog.sh`).
6. **False-success results are literally impossible**: every gate has a
   mutation-test pair; any always-PASS gate is immediately rewritten.
7. **Flock is sacred**: `commit_all.sh` and `push_all.sh` are
   serialised via `.git/.commit_all.lock` / `.git/.push_all.lock`.
   Never bypass — concurrent invocations corrupt the split-archive
   temp-branch workflow.

Non-compliance is a blocker regardless of context. Refer to the
Constitution for full definitions, enforcement notes, and the canonical
commit / push / tag sequence.
