Critical universal rules every CLI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Aider,
Codex, Gemini CLI) MUST honour while working in this module:

- **No bluffing.** Every PASS carries positive evidence. Constitution §11.4.
- **Mutation-paired gates.** Every new gate has a paired mutation
  proving it catches regressions. Constitution §1.1.
- **No guessing language** (`likely`, `probably`, `maybe`, `seems`).
  Constitution §11.4.6.
- **Credentials never tracked.** `.env` patterns git-ignored; runtime-load
  only. Constitution §11.4.10.
- **Never force-push.** Force-push requires explicit per-session
  authorization AND a green §9.1.5 post-op gate. Constitution §9.
- **CONTINUATION.md kept in sync** in every non-trivial commit.
  Constitution §12.10.
- **60% RAM cap.** Heavy work wrapped in bounded execution scope.
  Constitution §12.6.

# AGENTS.md — mpv-player submodule (ATMOSphere 1.1.3-dev-0.0.6+)

Every AI agent working in this submodule MUST comply with the canonical
[ATMOSphere Constitution](../../../../../docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md)
in the parent repo.

## Non-negotiable summary

1. **Tests for every change**: pre-build `CM-MC*` gate, post-build gate,
   on-device test, and a mutation entry in
   `scripts/testing/meta_test_false_positive_proof.sh` proving the gate
   catches regressions.
2. **Both devices flashed and green** before any tag.
3. **Commit + push via `bash scripts/commit_all.sh "…"` from the
   parent repo root.** For submodule source changes: commit inside the
   submodule first, push to every submodule remote, THEN run parent's
   `commit_all.sh` to capture the updated pointer.
4. **Tags cascade**: every main-repo tag mirrored on this submodule at
   its current HEAD, across every remote this submodule publishes to.
   Use `scripts/testing/release_tag.sh <tag>` from the parent.
5. **Changelog discipline**: every tag has `docs/changelogs/<tag>.md`
   + HTML + JSON + TXT exports (`scripts/testing/export_changelog.sh`).
6. **False-success results are literally impossible**: every gate has a
   mutation-test pair; any always-PASS gate is immediately rewritten.
7. **Flock is sacred**: `commit_all.sh` and `push_all.sh` are
   serialised via `.git/.commit_all.lock` / `.git/.push_all.lock`.
   Never bypass — concurrent invocations corrupt the split-archive
   temp-branch workflow.

Non-compliance is a blocker regardless of context. Refer to the
Constitution for full definitions, enforcement notes, and the canonical
commit / push / tag sequence.


## MANDATORY HOST-SESSION SAFETY (Constitution §12)

**Forensic incident, 2026-04-27 22:22:14 (MSK):** the developer's
`user@1000.service` was SIGKILLed under an OOM cascade triggered by
`pip3 install --user openai-whisper` running on top of chronic
podman-pod memory pressure. The cascade SIGKILLed gnome-shell, every
ssh session, claude-code, tmux, btop, npm, node, java, pip3 — full
session loss. Evidence: `journalctl --since "2026-04-27 22:00"
--until "2026-04-27 22:23"`.

This invariant applies to **every script, test, helper, and AI agent**
in this submodule. Non-compliance is a release blocker.

### Forbidden — directly OR indirectly

1. **Suspending the host**: `systemctl suspend`, `pm-suspend`,
   `loginctl suspend`, DBus `org.freedesktop.login1.Suspend`,
   GNOME idle-suspend, lid-close handler.
2. **Hibernating / hybrid-sleeping**: any `Hibernate` / `HybridSleep`
   / `SuspendThenHibernate` method.
3. **Logging out the user**: `loginctl terminate-session`,
   `pkill -u <user>`, `systemctl --user --kill`, anything that
   signals `user@<uid>.service`.
4. **Unbounded-memory operations** inside `user@<uid>.service`
   cgroup. Any single command expected to exceed 4 GB RSS MUST be
   wrapped in `bounded_run` (defined in
   `scripts/lib/host_session_safety.sh`, parent repo).
5. **Programmatic rfkill toggles, lid-switch handlers, or
   power-button handlers** — these cascade into idle-actions.
6. **Disabling systemd-logind, GDM, or session managers** "to make
   things faster" — even temporary stops leave the system unable to
   recover the user session.

### Required safeguards

Every script in this submodule that performs heavy work (build,
transcription, model inference, large compression, multi-GB git op)
MUST:

1. Source `scripts/lib/host_session_safety.sh` from the parent repo.
2. Call `host_check_safety` at the top and **abort if it fails**.
3. Wrap any subprocess expected to exceed ~4 GB RSS in
   `bounded_run "<name>" <max-mem> <max-time> -- <cmd...>` so the
   kernel OOM killer is contained to that scope and cannot escalate
   to user.slice.
4. Cap parallelism (`-j`) to fit available RAM (each AOSP job ≈ 5 GB
   peak RSS).

### Container hygiene

Containers (Docker / Podman) we own or rely on MUST:

1. Declare an explicit memory limit (`mem_limit` / `--memory` /
   `MemoryMax`).
2. Set `OOMPolicy=stop` in their systemd unit to avoid retry loops.
3. Use exponential-backoff restart policies, never immediate retry.
4. Be clean-slate destroyed (`podman pod stop && rm`, `podman
   volume prune`) and rebuilt after any host crash or session loss
   so stale lock files don't keep producing failures.

### When in doubt

Don't run heavy work blind. Check `journalctl -k --since "1 hour ago"
| grep -c oom-kill`. If it's non-zero, **fix the offending workload
first**. Do not stack new work on a host already in distress.

## MANDATORY ANTI-BLUFF VALIDATION (Constitution §8.1 + §11)

**This submodule inherits the parent ATMOSphere project's anti-bluff covenant.
A test that PASSes while the feature it claims to validate is unusable to an
end user is the single most damaging failure mode in this codebase. It has
shipped working-on-paper / broken-on-device builds before, and that MUST NOT
happen again.**

The canonical authority is `docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md` §8.1
("NO BLUFF — positive-evidence-only validation") and §11 ("Bleeding-edge
ultra-perfection") in the parent repo. Every contribution to THIS submodule
is bound by it. Summarised non-negotiables:

1. **Tests MUST validate user-visible behaviour, not just metadata.** A gate
   that greps for a string in a config XML, an XML attribute, a manifest
   entry, or a build-time symbol is METADATA — not evidence the feature
   works for the end user. Such a gate is allowed ONLY when paired with a
   runtime / on-device test that exercises the user-visible path and reads
   POSITIVE EVIDENCE that the behaviour actually occurred (kernel `/proc/*`
   runtime state, captured audio/video, dumpsys output produced *during*
   playback, real input-event delivery, real surface composition, etc).
2. **PASS / FAIL / SKIP must be mechanically distinguishable.** SKIP is for
   environment limitations (no HDMI sink, no USB mic, geo-restricted endpoint
   unreachable) and MUST always carry an explicit reason. PASS is reserved
   for cases where positive evidence was observed. A test that completes
   without observing evidence MUST NOT report PASS.
3. **Every gate MUST have a paired mutation test in
   `scripts/testing/meta_test_false_positive_proof.sh` (parent repo).** The
   mutation deliberately breaks the feature and the gate MUST then FAIL.
   A gate without a paired mutation is a BLUFF gate and is a Constitution
   violation regardless of how many checks it appears to make.
4. **Challenges (HelixQA) and tests are in the same boat.** A Challenge that
   reports "completed" by checking the test runner exited 0, without
   observing the system behaviour the Challenge is supposed to verify, is a
   bluff. Challenge runners MUST cross-reference real device telemetry
   (logcat, captured frames, network probes, kernel state) to confirm the
   user-visible promise was kept.
5. **The bar for shipping is not "tests pass" but "users can use the feature."**
   If the on-device experience does not match what the test claims, the test
   is the bug. Fix the test (positive-evidence harder), do not silence it.
6. **No false-success results are tolerable.** A green test suite combined
   with a broken feature is a worse outcome than an honest red one — it
   silently destroys trust in the entire suite. Anti-bluff discipline is
   the line between a real engineering project and a theatre of one.

When in doubt: capture runtime evidence, attach it to the test result, and
let a hostile reviewer (i.e. yourself, in six months) try to disprove that
the feature really worked. If they can, the test is bluff and must be hardened.

parent AGENTS.md "NO BLUFF" section, parent `scripts/testing/meta_test_false_positive_proof.sh`.

## MANDATORY ABSOLUTE DATA SAFETY — ZERO RISK (Constitution §9)

**EVERY destructive repository operation** (history rewrite, force-push,
branch deletion, bulk file removal, submodule de-init, object pruning) MUST
follow Constitution §9 without exception:

1. **Hardlinked backup first** — near-instant (`cp -al .git <backup>/repo.git.mirror`),
   zero extra disk. No excuse to skip. Parent-repo helper:
   `scripts/testing/safe_history_rewrite.sh --pre-op`.
2. **Record pre-op metadata** — refs, tags, submodule pointers, HEAD commit,
   HEAD tree hash, HEAD tree content sha256.
3. **Run the operation** — never with hook-bypassing flags unless the user
   has explicitly authorized them for that exact operation.
4. **Post-op gate** — HEAD tree byte-identical (unless explicitly expected
   to change), all tags preserved, all submodule pointers intact, all
   domain-specific integrity checks pass. ANY failure → restore immediately
   from the hardlinked backup.
5. **Force-push is NEVER automatic** — `push_all.sh` (in parent repo) must
   not force-push as a failure-recovery path. Every force-push requires
   explicit per-session human authorization AND a passing §9 post-op gate.
6. **Audit trail** — force-push events recorded in parent repo
   `docs/changelogs/<tag>.md`.

Data-safety violations are catastrophic (irreversible once the remote GCs
dangling objects) and block the release cycle until fully remediated.

## MANDATORY ANTI-BLUFF COVENANT — END-USER QUALITY GUARANTEE (User mandate, 2026-04-28)

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim):**

> "We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability by end users of the product!"

This is the historical origin of the project's anti-bluff covenant.
Every test, every Challenge, every gate, every mutation pair exists
to make the failure mode (PASS on broken-for-end-user feature)
mechanically impossible.

**Operative rule:** the bar for shipping is **not** "tests pass"
but **"users can use the feature."** Every PASS in this codebase
MUST carry positive evidence captured during execution that the
feature works for the end user. Metadata-only PASS, configuration-
only PASS, "absence-of-error" PASS, and grep-based PASS without
runtime evidence are all critical defects regardless of how green
the summary line looks.

**Tests AND Challenges (HelixQA) are bound equally** — a Challenge
that scores PASS on a non-functional feature is the same class of
defect as a unit test that does. Both must produce positive end-
user evidence; both are subject to the §8.1 five-constraint rule
and §11 captured-evidence requirement.

**Canonical authority:** parent
[`docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md`](../../docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md)
§8.1 (positive-evidence-only validation) + §11 (bleeding-edge
ultra-perfection quality bar) + §11.3 (the "no bluff" CLAUDE.md /
AGENTS.md mandate) + **§11.4 (this end-user-quality-guarantee
forensic anchor — propagation requirement enforced by pre-build
gate `CM-COVENANT-PROPAGATION`)**.

**§11.4.1 extension (Phase 33, 2026-05-05) — FAIL-bluffs equally
forbidden.** A test that crashes for a script-internal reason
(undefined variable under `set -u`, regex error, malformed assertion,
missing argument) and produces a FAIL exit code is just as misleading
as a PASS-bluff. Both let real defects ship undetected. Per parent
[Constitution §11.4.1](../../../../docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md#114-end-user-quality-guarantee--forensic-anchor-user-mandate-2026-04-28),
every test MUST fail ONLY for genuine product defects — script-bug
failures must be fixed at the source layer (helper library, shared
lib, test source), not patched in individual call sites.

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

**§11.4.2 extension (Phase 34, 2026-05-06) — Recorded-evidence
requirement.** A test that emits PASS without captured visual or
audio evidence of the user-visible feature actually working on the
screen the user would see is a §11.4 PASS-bluff. Bug #13 (VK Video
on PRIMARY display while a passing test claimed playback PASS)
demonstrated the gap exactly. Closing it requires the recording +
analyzer infrastructure (Bug #14 — `dual_display_record.sh` /
`action_timeline.sh` / Go `recording-analyzer` / `helixqa-bridge`).
Per Constitution §11.4.2 every PASS for a user-visible feature
MUST be cross-checked by the analyzer against the dual-display
recording + action timeline. A PASS that lacks at least one matched
timeline event in the analyzer findings is treated as a §11.4
PASS-bluff.

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

**§11.4.3 extension (Phase 34, 2026-05-06) — Per-device-topology
test dispatch.** Tests that depend on hardware topology (secondary
HDMI present/absent, microphone present/absent, etc.) MUST detect
topology at test entry and dispatch the topology-appropriate
variant. A test running the wrong variant for the actual topology
and PASSing is a §11.4 PASS-bluff. Bug #18 (Lampa+TorrServe E2E)
demonstrated the pattern: D1 (secondary HDMI) and D2 (primary only)
get separate test variants behind a `dumpsys display`-based
dispatcher. Per Constitution §11.4.3 every topology-touching test
MUST have such a dispatcher OR explicit topology gates with
SKIP-with-reason fallback.

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

**§11.4.4 extension (User mandate, 2026-05-06) —
Test-interrupt-on-discovery + retest-from-clean-baseline.** A test
cycle that continues running past a freshly discovered defect is
itself a §11.4 PASS-bluff: it produces "all green" summaries while
the codebase under test is known-broken at the moment those greens
were recorded. Phase 34.S' D1 demonstrated the violation when Bug
#26 (hard-floor probe lifecycle) and Bug #27 (analyzer FAIL-bluff
on non-video tests) were discovered mid-cycle and the cycle was
allowed to continue, accumulating 13+ false-positive ANALYZER FAIL
banners. Per Constitution §11.4.4 the moment any defect is re-
discovered, re-produced, or newly identified during a test cycle,
the cycle MUST stop on both devices. **Then**: (1) fix at root cause
per §11.4.1, (2) land validation/verification tests for the fix —
pre-build gate AND on-device test AND paired meta-test mutation,
(3) full rebuild via `scripts/build.sh` (regardless of whether the
fix touched host script / Go binary / firmware — host-only fixes
still get a full rebuild for retest baseline integrity),
(4) re-flash D1 + D2, (5) repeat full `test_all_fixes.sh` from the
beginning sequentially per §12.6, (6) end the cycle with
`meta_test_false_positive_proof.sh` proving no gate is itself a
bluff gate. Tests AND HelixQA Challenges are bound equally —
Challenges that score PASS on a non-functional feature are the same
class of defect as PASS-bluff unit tests; both must produce
positive end-user evidence per §11.4.2 + §11.4.3.

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

**§11.4.4 expansion (User mandate, 2026-05-06) — Systematic
debugging + four-layer test coverage + documentation + no-bluff
certification.** Augments the §11.4.4 base covenant with four
non-negotiable additional requirements per the User mandate of
2026-05-06: (a) **Systematic debugging via superpowers skills.**
Before applying any fix, run in-depth systematic debugging using the
available `superpowers:*` skills (debugging, root-cause analysis,
architectural-impact). Symptom patches are forbidden. The debugging
output MUST identify root cause at source layer, blast radius across
related tests/features/subsystems, and the regression-protection
seam. (b) **Four-layer test coverage per fix.** Every fix lands with
positive evidence in **every applicable layer**: pre-build gate
(catches at source), post-build gate (catches in assembled image —
proves bytes landed, cf. Fix #122 APK_LIB_MAP misroute), post-flash
on-device test (fully automated, anti-bluff per §8.1, captured-
evidence per §11.4.2, topology-dispatched per §11.4.3, orchestrator-
wired in `test_all_fixes.sh`), HelixQA test bank entry
(`banks/atmosphere.yaml` + per-feature additions), HelixQA full QA
session coverage (Challenge-driven dispatch — bank entry without
Challenge coverage is a §11.4 PASS-bluff), and meta-test paired
mutation. Skipping a layer because "this fix only touches X" is
forbidden. (c) **Documentation update for every fix.** Required:
`docs/Issues.md` → `docs/Fixed.md` migration on closure, parent
CLAUDE.md Applied Fixes Reference row, affected user-facing guides
(`docs/guides/*.md`), affected diagrams/flowcharts/architecture
docs, per-version `docs/changelogs/<tag>.md` entry. Documentation
drift after a fix is itself a §11.4 violation. (d) **No-bluff
certification per cycle.** Before tagging: `meta_test_false_positive
_proof.sh` returns all gates green AND every gate's paired mutation
FAILs (no bluff gates); `docs/Issues.md` open-set is empty or every
entry explicitly classified out-of-scope-for-this-tag with operator
sign-off (no known issues hidden); full suite returns zero new FAILs
on either device (no working feature regressed); every gate has a
paired mutation; every test produces positive evidence; every
assertion catches its own negation (no error-prone or bluff-proof
leftover).

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

**§11.4.5 — Audio + video quality analysis comprehensiveness (User mandate, 2026-05-07)**

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim, 2026-05-07):**

> "We MUST HAVE still analyzing of recorded materials and comprehensive
> validation and verification for issues we used to test! For example
> if there is audio at all or video, if so, is it good and proper or
> is it faulty? Does it have glitches, frame issues and other possible
> obstructions? IMPORTANT: Make sure that all existing tests and
> Challenges do work in anti-bluff manner — they MUST confirm that all
> tested codebase really works as expected!"

§11.4.2 mandates *captured* evidence; §11.4.5 mandates the **content**
of that evidence be analyzed for quality, not merely for presence. A
test that captures a 0-byte mp4 (Bug #24) and PASSes because "the
recording file exists" is the exact PASS-bluff pattern §11.4 forbids.
Content-quality analysis is what closes that gap.

**Audio quality analysis — every audio test that PASSes MUST verify
ALL of:** (1) **Presence** — non-trivial RMS amplitude in captured
WAV / `/proc/asound/.../pcm*p/sub0/hw_params`. (2) **Channel count**
— `ffprobe -show_streams` matches the test's claim (2.0 / 5.1 / 7.1).
(3) **Sample rate + bit depth** — match the codec / pipeline under
test. (4) **Glitch census** — XRUN / FastMixer underrun-overrun-partial
/ AudioFlinger writeError counts above tolerance MUST classify
explicitly (PASS within budget, WARN above, FAIL on hard limits per
§11.4.1 SKIP-vs-FAIL decision tree). (5) **Coexistence-artifact
census** — for tests that exercise WiFi/BT alongside audio: BT TX
queue overflow, A2DP src underflow, coex notification storms, 2.4 GHz
radio contention.

**Video quality analysis — every video test that PASSes MUST verify
ALL of:** (1) **Presence** — captured screen recording has non-zero
file size AND `ffprobe -count_frames` reports decoded-frame total > 0.
0-byte mp4 (Bug #24) is the canonical PASS-bluff and triggers §11.4.4
STOP. (2) **Routing target** — analyzer + action-timeline confirms
video appeared on the *intended* display (primary vs secondary HDMI;
Bug #13 pattern). (3) **Frame health** — drop count, frame-time
variance (jitter), freeze detection (SSIM > 0.99 for ≥ 1 s), tearing.
(4) **Obstruction census** — Tesseract OCR scan for hostile overlays
(`Application not responding`, `Force close`, sign-in dialog,
geo-restriction overlay, ad break, paywall, `App is not certified`).
(5) **Resolution + codec** — captured frame dimensions match the
test's claim; downgrade is a PASS-bluff.

**Challenges (HelixQA) are bound equally** — every Challenge that
asserts PASS MUST run all five audio + five video layers. A Challenge
that scores PASS without applicable analysis is the same class of
defect as a unit test that does.

**Tooling guarantee:** audio = `tinycap` + `aplay --dump-hw-params` +
`ffprobe` + `/proc/asound` parsers (`lib/audio_validation.sh` per
§11.2.5). Video = `screenrecord` + `ffprobe -count_frames` +
`recording-analyzer` + Tesseract OCR (`scripts/dual_display_record.sh`
+ `cmd/recording-analyzer/` per §11.4.2.A and §11.4.2.C). Tests
dispatched against video evidence MUST honor §11.4.4
test-interrupt-on-discovery when the analyzer reports empty input —
do not silently absorb that as a generic PASS-bluff banner.

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.



## MANDATORY §12 HOST-SESSION SAFETY — INCIDENT #2 ANCHOR (2026-04-28)

**Second forensic incident:** on 2026-04-28 18:36:35 MSK the user's
`user@1000.service` was again SIGKILLed (`status=9/KILL`), this time
WITHOUT a kernel OOM kill (systemd-oomd inactive, `MemoryMax=infinity`)
— a different vector than Incident #1. Cascade killed `claude`,
`tmux`, the in-flight ATMOSphere build, and 20+ npm MCP server
processes. Likely cumulative cgroup pressure + external watchdog.

**Mandatory safeguards effective 2026-04-28** (full text in parent
[`docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md`](../../../../docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md)
§12 Incident #2):

1. `scripts/build.sh` MUST source `lib/host_session_safety.sh` and
   call `host_check_safety` BEFORE any heavy step.
2. `host_check_safety` has 7 distress detectors including conmon
   cgroup-events warnings (#6) and current-boot session-kill events
   (#7).
3. Containers MUST be clean-slate destroyed + rebuilt after any
   suspected §12 incident. `mem_limit` is per-container, not
   per-user-slice — operator MUST cap Σ `mem_limit` ≤ physical RAM
   − user-session overhead.
4. 20+ npm-spawned MCP server processes are a known memory multiplier;
   stop non-essential MCPs before heavy ATMOSphere work.
5. **Investigation: Docker/Podman as session-loss vector.** Per-container
   cgroups don't prevent cumulative user-slice pressure; conmon
   `Failed to open cgroups file: /sys/fs/cgroup/memory.events`
   warnings preceded the 18:36:35 SIGKILL by 6 min — likely correlated.

This directive applies to every owned ATMOSphere repo and every
HelixQA dependency. Non-compliance is a Constitution §12 violation.



## MANDATORY §12.6 MEMORY-BUDGET CEILING — 60% MAXIMUM (User mandate, 2026-04-30)

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim):**

> "We had to restart this session 3rd time in a row! The system of
> the host stays with no RAM memory for some reason! First make sure
> that whatever we do through our procedures related to this project
> MUST NOT use more than 60% of total system memory! All processes
> MUST be able to function normally!"

**The mandate.** Project procedures MUST NOT use more than **60%
of total system RAM** (`HOST_SAFETY_MAX_MEM_PCT`). The remaining
40% is reserved for the operator's other workloads so the host can
keep serving them while project work proceeds.

**Three consecutive session-loss SIGKILLs on 2026-04-30** during
1.1.5-dev — every one happened while `scripts/build.sh` was running
`m -j5` AOSP. Each Soong/Ninja job peaks at ~5–8 GiB RSS;
collective RSS overran the 60% envelope and the kernel OOM-killer
escalated, taking down `user@1000.service`. **§12.1's pre-flight
check (refusing to start if host already distressed) was not enough**
— the missing piece was an active CONSTRAINT on heavy work itself.

**Mandatory protections (rock-solid):**

1. `HOST_SAFETY_MAX_MEM_PCT` defaults to 60 in
   `scripts/lib/host_session_safety.sh`.
2. `HOST_SAFETY_BUDGET_GB` is computed at source-time from
   `MemTotal × MAX_PCT/100`.
3. `bounded_run` clamps `MemoryMax` down to the budget if the
   caller asks for more (cgroup-level enforcement via
   `systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=…`).
4. `host_safe_parallel_jobs` and `host_safe_build_jobs` return
   the safe `-j` count given an estimated per-job RSS, capped at
   `nproc`.
5. `scripts/build.sh` wraps `m -j` in `bounded_run`. If the
   build's collective RSS exceeds the budget, only the scope is
   OOM-killed; `user@<uid>.service` stays alive.

**Captured-evidence enforcement.** Pre-build gate
`CM-MEMBUDGET-METATEST` locks all 7 invariants and fires every
pre-build run.

**No escape hatch.** §12.6 has NO operator-facing override flag.
The cap exists for the operator's own protection; bypassing it is
the bluff the §11.4 covenant specifically prohibits. Operators who
need more headroom should reduce parallelism, close other
workloads, or add RAM — NOT raise the percentage.

**Canonical authority:** parent
[`docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md`](../../docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md)
§12.6.

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

## MANDATORY §12.10 CONTINUATION DOCUMENT MAINTENANCE (User mandate, 2026-05-07)

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim):**

> "during any work we perfrom, during Phases implementation,
> debugging and fixing, during ANY effort we have the Continuation
> document MUST BE maintained and it MUST NOT BE out of sync with
> current work we are doing! If for any reson we stop our work, we
> MUST BE able to continue any time, with current work, exactly
> where we have left of and from any CLI agent or any LLM model we
> chose! Nothing can be broken or faulty in maintained Continuation
> document!"

**The mandate.** A single, canonical, machine-readable handoff
document — `docs/CONTINUATION.md` at the parent repo root — must
always reflect the live state of the project. Any agent (human,
Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Codex, Gemini CLI, any future LLM) must
be able to resume work **exactly where the previous session left off**
by reading this single file.

**Mandatory protections (no escape hatch):**

1. **`docs/CONTINUATION.md` MUST exist** at the parent repo root.
2. **Every non-trivial state change** — work item started / completed
   / blocked, new bug discovered, phase transition, build state
   change, fix applied, gate added, mutation paired — MUST update
   this document **in the same commit** as the work itself. Commits
   that change source/tests/docs but leave CONTINUATION.md stale are
   non-compliant.
3. **Top-of-file `Last updated:`** ISO timestamp updated on every edit.
4. **Section §3 "Active work"** must list every IN PROGRESS / BLOCKED
   item with concrete commands, file paths, monitor IDs, and
   percentages where relevant — enough that any agent can resume
   without conversation context.
5. **Section §0 "How to use this document"** must contain the
   verbatim resumption prompt — a single block any operator can
   paste into any CLI agent.
6. **Document MUST be self-contained** — no hyperlinks to ephemeral
   external systems as the only source of truth.

**Captured-evidence enforcement.** Pre-build gate
`CM-CONTINUATION-DOC-INSYNC` locks 7 invariants (file exists, has
Last-updated timestamp, timestamp recent enough, has §0 / §3 / §8
sections, line count ≥ 100). Pre-build gate
`CM-CONTINUATION-DOC-PROPAGATION` verifies §12.10 text is present
across parent CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md and all 10 owned submodules'
CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md.

**Commit-time enforcement.** `scripts/commit_all.sh` refuses to
commit if the staged change-set touches source / tests / gates but
leaves `docs/CONTINUATION.md` untouched, with explicit override flag
`--continuation-no-update-needed` (rationale captured in commit
message).

**Paired mutation.** `meta_test_false_positive_proof.sh`
`CM-CONTINUATION-DOC-INSYNC mutation` deletes the `Last updated:`
line and asserts the gate FAILs.

**No escape hatch.** §12.10 has NO operator-facing override flag for
the existence requirement. The discipline exists for the operator's
own protection — the moment the document drifts from reality is the
moment session-loss becomes catastrophic.

**§11.4.6 — No-guessing mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-08)**

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim, 2026-05-08T18:30 MSK):**

> "'LIKELY' is guessing, we MUST NOT have guessing, since it can be
> or may not be! No bluffing and uncertainity is allowed at any cost!
> We MUST always know exactly precisly what is happening exactly, in
> any context, under any conditions, everywhere!"

Tests, gates, status reports, closure narratives, commit messages, and
operator-facing text MUST NOT use `likely`, `probably`, `maybe`,
`might`, `possibly`, `presumably`, `seems`, or `appears to` when
describing causes of failures, behaviour, or fix effectiveness. Either
prove the cause with captured forensic evidence (logcat, dmesg, /sys
readings, getprop, kernel ramoops, dropbox, strace, etc.) and state it
as fact, OR explicitly mark `UNCONFIRMED:` / `UNKNOWN:` /
`PENDING_FORENSICS:` with a tracked-task ID for follow-up.

Pre-build gate `CM-NO-GUESSING-MANDATE` greps recently-modified docs
+ test scripts for the forbidden vocabulary outside explicit
`UNCONFIRMED:` / `UNKNOWN:` / `PENDING_FORENSICS:` blocks. Paired

**§11.4.7 — Demotion-evidence rule (Phase 38.X+2 amendment, 2026-05-11)**

A demotion from any FAIL classification (`OPEN`, `POSSIBLE PRODUCT
DEFECT`, `FAIL`) to a lower-severity classification (`INVESTIGATED`,
`MITIGATED`, `RESOLVED`, `WORKING-AS-INTENDED`) requires positive
evidence captured under the **same conditions** that originally
exposed the defect — same device, same firmware, same cycle position,
same load profile.

"I cannot reproduce in isolation" is a HYPOTHESIS, not a finding. Per
§11.4.6 it MUST be tagged `UNCONFIRMED:` until same-conditions retest
produces positive evidence. The expanded forbidden-vocabulary list:

| Forbidden phrase | Why it bluffs |
|---|---|
| "isolated re-run PASSes therefore X was a flake" | Strips the very environment that exposed the defect. |
| "runtime drift" | Label for "we don't know what changed". |
| "intermittent" / "transient" | Label for "we don't know how to reproduce". |
| "pending stress retest" | Defers the actual investigation indefinitely. |
| "correlates with X" | Hypothesis presented as causation. |

Pre-build gate `CM-DEMOTION-EVIDENCE-RULE` scans Issues.md / Fixed.md

**§11.4.8 — Deep-web-research-before-implementation mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-12)**

Before designing a non-trivial fix, implementing a new feature, or declaring
an architectural choice, perform deep web research to verify the chosen
approach is informed by current state-of-the-art. Research surface:
official documentation (Android/AOSP/Khronos/CEA-861/AES/IEEE/IETF/ITU),
vendor technical guides (Rockchip, Sipeed, Audinate Dante, Synaptics,
Realtek, Bluetooth SIG), open-source codebases (Linux kernel, ALSA, Bluez,
ExoPlayer, libVLC, MPV, FFmpeg, AOSP forks), coding tutorials + technical
articles (Stack Overflow, AOSP Code Lab, AES papers), issue trackers
(Android bug tracker, AOSP gerrit, GitHub issues).

A fix that re-invents a wheel — or reproduces a known-broken pattern —
when the open-source community has already solved the problem is a §11.4
violation by omission. Every non-trivial fix's commit / Issues.md / Fixed.md
entry MUST cite at least one external source URL OR the literal "NO external
solution found — original work".

Pre-build gate `CM-RESEARCH-CITATION-PRESENT` scans new fix-direction

**§11.4.9 — Batch-source-fixes-before-rebuild mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-12)**

When closing a multi-defect batch, all source-side fixes that DO NOT require
runtime on-device validation to design MUST be landed BEFORE the next firmware
rebuild. Anti-pattern eliminated: `Fix A → rebuild → flash → cycle → fix B → rebuild → ...`
serializes 7-8 hours per fix instead of batching all into ONE build cycle.
Operator time is the scarce resource.

Exceptions documented in commit message as `REQUIRES_REBUILD: <reason>`:
kernel-5.10/ changes, atmosphere-*.sh boot-script side-effects, hardware/rockchip/
HAL behavior — each gates downstream state and requires firmware to validate.

Before declaring a batch "ready for rebuild": pre-build GREEN + meta-test GREEN +
existing-device validations performed where possible + Issues.md/Fixed.md/CONTINUATION.md
in sync (+ HTML/PDF exported) + §11.4.8 research citations all logged.

**§11.4.10 — Credentials-handling mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-12)**

All credentials, secrets, API tokens, passwords, phone numbers, OAuth tokens,
signing keys MUST NEVER live in tracked files. Templates with placeholder values
are allowed (`.example` suffix). Tests load credentials at runtime from
`scripts/testing/secrets/` (or per-submodule equivalent); operator-populated
files are `chmod 600`, directory is `chmod 700`. `.env`, `.env.*`, `*.env`
patterns + `scripts/testing/secrets/*` (with `.example` + `README.md` exception)
git-ignored project-wide.

Test scripts MUST NEVER echo credentials to stdout/stderr/logcat. Screen-
recording of sign-in flows MUST redact credential-bearing frames. Per-service
file separation (`.netflix.env`, `.disney.env`, etc.) limits blast radius.

Forensic-rotation policy: suspected leak → rotate at provider, update local
`.env`, audit captured artifacts. Pre-build gate `CM-CREDENTIAL-LEAK-SCAN`

`input keyevent KEYCODE_MEDIA_STOP` + register cleanup in `EXIT` trap.
Verified via positive evidence (Arvus codec-state → `N.E.`,

Status MUST be updated as the item progresses through its lifecycle. `Fixed` requires captured-evidence per §11.4.5 + migration to Fixed.md.

The auto-generated `docs/Issues_Summary.md` includes the Status column. All three file types (`.md`, `.html`, `.pdf`) MUST be in sync at all times — enforced by `CM-DOCS-EXPORT-SYNC` (§11.4.12 + §11.4.15 amendment).

the test suite MUST consume the sink's report as captured-evidence for
every audio test asserting a codec / channel-count / passthrough mode.
On-SoC HAL telemetry ALONE is insufficient — that is the exact "tests
pass but the feature doesn't work" pattern §11.4 forbids. Reference:

**§11.4.11 — File-layout discipline (User mandate, 2026-05-12)**

Files live in canonical directories per type:

- Log files → `logs/` (legacy: `logs/legacy/`)
- Release artifacts → `releases/<app>/<version>/`
- Operator credentials → `scripts/testing/secrets/` (per §11.4.10, git-ignored)
- Markdown docs → `docs/` + `docs/guides/` + `docs/research/` + `docs/superpowers/plans/`
- Per-version changelogs → `docs/changelogs/`
- Hardware ID photos → `docs/hardware/<device-slug>/`

Repo root contains ONLY: AOSP-mandated top-level files (Android.bp, Makefile,
bootstrap.bash, BUILD, kokoro, lk_inc.mk, OWNERS, version_defaults.mk),
project metadata (README/CLAUDE/AGENTS/CONTRIBUTING/LICENSE/NOTICE/VERSION),
dot-files (.gitignore/.gitmodules), and standard top-level dirs (build/,
device/, external/, frameworks/, hardware/, kernel-5.10/, packages/, prebuilts/,
scripts/, system/, tools/, vendor/, docs/, releases/, logs/).

NO bash scripts in repo root except AOSP-mandated `bootstrap.bash`. NO log
files in repo root. NO duplicate filenames between root and `scripts/`. NO
release artifacts in root. Moves require triple-verification (audit all
references + distinguish absolute vs subdir-local + confirm no AOSP build-

— sit at `docs/` root by design. They are architectural constants
of the project layout, analogous to AOSP's `Makefile`, `Android.bp`,

§11.4.44 + §11.4.53 propagation gates plus the helper-script

coordinated amendment of those 6 sister anchors plus 5 pre-build
gates plus ~20 helper scripts plus 42 consumer files in a single
PWU. Per §11.4.66, that scope is operator-blocked until explicitly
authorised. Audit-snapshot files (`docs/audit/anti_bluff_audit.md`,
`docs/audit/PRE_SONOS_TAG_READINESS.md`,
`docs/audit/D1_WIFI_FAIL_CLASSIFICATION.md`, plus any future audit
snapshots) DO move under `docs/audit/` per the §11.4.11 general

**§11.4.33 — Type-aware closure-status vocabulary (User mandate, 2026-05-15)**

§11.4.15 defined the lifecycle Status closed-set including terminal
`Fixed (→ Fixed.md)`. §11.4.16 defined the Type closed-set
`{Bug | Feature | Task}`. §11.4.33 binds the two — closure terminal
value MUST agree with the item Type: `Bug` → `Fixed (→ Fixed.md)`,
`Feature` → `Implemented (→ Fixed.md)`, `Task` → `Completed (→ Fixed.md)`.
The `(→ Fixed.md)` suffix is preserved so existing migration tooling
(atomic Issues.md → Fixed.md move per §11.4.19) keeps working.
Generators treat the three terminal values as semantically equivalent
(all closed, positive evidence captured) but preserve the literal in
emitted docs. Closing a `Feature` with `Fixed (→ Fixed.md)` or a
`Task` with `Implemented (→ Fixed.md)` is a §11.4.33 violation.

heading, capturing four sub-facts: **By:** `AI` or `User`; **On:**
ISO date; **Reason:** one of `{ test-failed | manual-testing-detected
| captured-evidence-contradicts | end-user-report | cycle-re-discovered
| design-reconsidered }` or explicit free text; **Evidence:** path or
short description of the captured artefact. Reopens without evidence
are §11.4.6 / §11.4.7 violations: the reopen IS a demotion-from-Fixed
change. Issues_Summary.md Status column MUST distinguish Reopened
sub-states by source (e.g. `Reopened (AI: test-failed)` vs
`Reopened (User: manual-testing)`). Pre-build gate

**§11.4.35 — Canonical-root inheritance clarity (User mandate, 2026-05-15)**

**The constitution submodule's three files
(`constitution/Constitution.md`, `constitution/CLAUDE.md`,
`constitution/AGENTS.md`) ARE the canonical root** — also called the
parent files. Universal rules per §11.4.17 live there.

**This submodule's `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are consumer
extensions** of the parent ATMOSphere-Android-15 project, which is
itself a consumer extension of the constitution submodule. Both
layers open with an inheritance pointer (the `## INHERITED FROM`
heading near the top of each, or `@constitution/CLAUDE.md` for
agents that resolve `@imports`). This submodule's files contain
only rules specific to this submodule's role inside ATMOSphere
(player wiring, on-device test contract, build-step integration,
APK module name, applicationId conventions). Project-wide
ATMOSphere rules live in the parent ATMOSphere-Android-15
`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`. Universal rules live in the constitution
submodule.

When in doubt: universal rule → constitution submodule;
ATMOSphere-wide rule → parent project repo root; this-submodule-only
rule → this file. Default to the narrowest layer when uncertain.
"Parent CLAUDE.md" / "root Constitution" → constitution submodule
file at `constitution/<filename>`, NEVER this submodule's own
`CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` and NEVER the parent ATMOSphere-Android-15
project root files. Moving a rule between layers MUST be a visible
commit — `git mv` + an explicit
"Lifted from <source-layer> to <target-layer> per §11.4.35" line in
the message. AI agents MUST NOT silently re-author a §11.4.X anchor

**§11.4.40 — Full-suite retest before release tag mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-17)**

A release tag MUST NOT be created until a COMPLETE retest with ALL existing tests has been executed on a clean baseline AFTER every workable item in the batch is done, fixed, polished, and individually verified. Spot-check retests that run only the tests touched by the batch are FORBIDDEN — they miss interaction defects between the batch's fixes and previously-stable code.

The complete retest comprises: (1) pre-build full sweep, (2) post-build full sweep, (3) on-device 4-phase cycle on EVERY owned device, (4) meta-test full mutation sweep, (5) Challenge bank full sweep, (6) Issues.md/Fixed.md state audit, (7) CONTINUATION.md sync check.

Time is essential — complete retest is typically 12–48 hour elapsed effort. NOT optional, NOT abbreviated. Skipping is the exact "tests passed but feature broken" failure mode §11.4 specifically prohibits.

Composes with §11.4.4 (per-fix retest) — §11.4.37 is the additional final integrity check at RELEASE granularity. Composes with §11.4.7 — full-suite retest is the authoritative baseline for closures in the batch. No escape hatch — no `--skip-full-retest` or `--quick-release` flag exists.

**§11.4.41 — Pre-Force-Push Merge-First Mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-17)**

Any force-push (`git push --force`, `git push --force-with-lease`, `git push +<ref>`, or equivalent history-rewriting operation on any remote) authorised under §9.2 / CONST-043 MUST be preceded by a mechanical 4-step merge-first pipeline that brings every remote-side commit into the local tree, resolves every conflict carefully, and verifies nothing is lost or corrupted on EITHER side BEFORE the overwriting push is executed.

**The 4-step pipeline (mandatory, in order):** (1) `git fetch --all --prune --tags` against every configured remote — capture output. (2) Integrate every divergent commit locally via `git rebase` (local is strict superset), `git merge` (independent additions both deserve preservation), or operator-confirmed cherry-pick (remote subset already present locally). (3) Audit: no conflict markers (`grep -rn '^<<<<<<< \|^=======$\|^>>>>>>> '` returns empty), no silent file drops (`git diff --stat HEAD@{1} HEAD`), every previously-passing test still passes per §11.4.4 / §11.4.40 baseline, every captured-evidence artifact still validates. (4) `git push --force-with-lease <remote> <ref>` (NEVER `--force` without `--with-lease` unless §9.2 sub-clause 6 explicitly authorises it for a remote where lease semantics are unavailable). One force-push event per CONST-043 authorisation — no batch authorisation.

**Two-gate composition with CONST-043** — §11.4.41 does NOT relax CONST-043's operator-approval requirement. Gate A (CONST-043): operator types explicit per-operation force-push authorisation. Gate B (§11.4.41): agent executes the 4-step merge-first pipeline, captures evidence of clean integration, presents evidence to operator BEFORE the force-push. Both gates required.

**Verification artefact** — every §11.4.41-governed force-push emits a `docs/changelogs/<tag>.md` "Force-push merge-first audit" section containing 7 elements: (i) `git fetch` output, (ii) per-remote `HEAD..<remote>/<branch>` log before integration, (iii) integration strategy chosen per remote with rationale, (iv) post-integration conflict-marker scan output (must be empty), (v) post-integration test suite delta (must show only expected changes), (vi) `--force-with-lease` push output with lease SHA evidence, (vii) CONST-043 authorisation quote from the conversation.

Composes with §9.2 (data-safety hardlinked backup), §11.4.4 (test-interrupt-on-discovery — broken integration triggers rollback), §11.4.6 (no-guessing — every step's outcome captured, not assumed), §11.4.26 (constitution-submodule update pipeline — per-submodule specialisation), §11.4.32 (post-pull validation — audit step's mechanical companion), §11.4.37 (fetch-before-edit — step 1 enforces it for force-push specifically), §11.4.40 (full-suite retest — step 3's test-evidence requirement).

No escape hatch — the operator-pressure escape ("just force-push, we'll fix it later") is the exact failure mode this anchor closes. Pre-build gate `CM-COVENANT-114-41-PROPAGATION` enforces this anchor in every CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md across parent + 10 owned submodules + nested submodules + HelixQA dependencies. Paired mutation strips the anchor literal → gate FAILs.

Every user-facing feature MUST have at least one autonomous validation path: end-to-end via `adb shell` + scripted automation, captured runtime evidence per §11.4.5, PASS/FAIL verdict WITHOUT human presence to drive UI, observe screen, or make decisions. Operator-attended tests are SUPPLEMENTARY, never PRIMARY. A feature whose ONLY validation path is operator-attended is a §11.4.52 violation — the path does not scale to CI, does not run on every commit, does not survive operator unavailability, and produces the exact "tests pass but feature doesn't work for users" failure mode §11.4 forbids.

Acceptable autonomous paths: (a) programmatic instrumentation APK (SDK-API exercises like `MediaCodec.createDecoderByName` + structured JSON result file); (b) headless intent dispatch + state poll (`am start --es` / `am broadcast` + `dumpsys` / `/proc/<pid>/maps` / `media.metrics` polling); (c) ADB-driven uiautomator (ONLY if hierarchy has ≥1 clickable node — empty hierarchy demands fallback to APK/intent); (d) network-side sink probe per §11.4.13; (e) HelixQA autonomous QA session per §11.4.27.

Coverage ledger (§11.4.25) classifies each feature as `AUTONOMOUS_VERIFIED` / `AUTONOMOUS_DESIGNED` / `OPERATOR_ATTENDED_ONLY` / `NOT_APPLICABLE`. `OPERATOR_ATTENDED_ONLY` blocks release until migrated; cite tracked work item per §11.4.15 + §11.4.16. Autonomous paths themselves MUST be anti-bluff: positive captured evidence + paired meta-test mutation per §1.1.

Composes with §11.4.25 (full-automation coverage), §11.4.27 (no-fakes + 100% type coverage), §11.4.39 (per-feature on-device end-user validation), §11.4.43 (TDD RED-first), §11.4.48 (UI-driven — fallback to APK/intent when uiautomator hierarchy empty), §11.4.49 (dual-approach), §11.4.50 (deterministic consistency), §11.4.51 (live-ADB-first).

Pre-build gates: `CM-COVENANT-114-52-PROPAGATION` + `CM-AF-AUTONOMOUS-PATH-PER-FEATURE`. Paired mutations. No escape hatch — no `--allow-operator-attended-only`, `--skip-autonomous-path`, `--manual-validation-suffices` flag.

**§11.4.53 — Fixed_Summary parity mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-18)**

**Forensic anchor — verbatim user mandate (2026-05-18T17:55Z):** "Note: Just like for Issues we have Issues_Summary, for Fixed we MUST HAVE Fixed_Summary - like all other docs: ALWAYS in sync and up to date and ALWAYS exported into the PDF and HTML! Add this mandatory rule / constraint into the root (constitution Submodule) Constitution, AGENTS.MD and CLAUDE.MD."

`docs/Fixed_Summary.md` is the symmetric short-form summary of `docs/Fixed.md`. MUST be regenerated whenever `Fixed.md` changes. HTML + PDF exports MUST travel with the markdown (identical mtimes within `sync_issues_docs.sh` granularity). Stale exports are §11.4.53 violations regardless of whether the underlying `.md` is correct. Same discipline as §11.4.12 Issues_Summary applied to Fixed.md.

Generator: `scripts/testing/generate_fixed_summary.sh` (canonical, executable, emits markdown table with `Status` + `Type` columns per §11.4.19 column-alignment). Auto-sync wrapper: `scripts/testing/sync_issues_docs.sh` regenerates BOTH summaries in one shot, exports HTML + PDF, colorizes per §11.4.23, re-renders PDFs. MUST be invoked after any edit to `Fixed.md`. No `--issues-only` flag exists, and §11.4.53 prohibits adding one.

Sort order: closure date DESC (most-recent-Fixed first), §-letter / Fix-# secondary. Documented at the top of the generated file.

Composes with §11.4.12 (Issues_Summary sibling — canonical pair), §11.4.19 (atomic Issues→Fixed migration trigger + column-alignment), §11.4.23 (colorizer post-processes both summaries), §11.4.33 (type-aware closure vocabulary — Fixed_Summary respects `Fixed (→ Fixed.md)` / `Implemented (→ Fixed.md)` / `Completed (→ Fixed.md)` terminal values), §11.4.44 (revision header applies to `Fixed_Summary.md`), §12.10 (CONTINUATION.md resumption guarantee).

Pre-build gates: `CM-FIXED-SUMMARY-SYNC` (6 invariants — Fixed_Summary exists + HTML/PDF mtime ≥ md mtime + Fixed_Summary mtime ≥ Fixed mtime + generator + sync wrapper invokes generator) + `CM-COVENANT-114-53-PROPAGATION` (anchor literal across canonical files). Paired mutations strip the anchor literal AND move the generator aside AND backdate Fixed_Summary mtime. No escape hatch — no `--skip-fixed-summary-sync`, `--issues-only`, `--summary-not-applicable` flag.

**§11.4.58 — Parallel-development methodology (User mandate, 2026-05-19)**

Project work proceeds through the **Parallel Work Unit (PWU)
pipeline** rather than sequential Phase-chain. Each PWU has: ATM-NNN
identifier (§11.4.54), Issues.md entry (§11.4.15+§11.4.16), file-scope
manifest, §11.4.43 RED test, source patch, pre-build gate, post-flash
test, paired §1.1 meta-test mutation, HelixQA Challenge bank entry,
captured-evidence directory (§11.4.5+§11.4.52).

**5-stage pipeline:** Stage 1 DEVELOP (parallel PWU agents in
worktrees) → Stage 2 MERGE (serial conductor + §11.4.41 4-step
merge-first) → Stage 3 REBUILD+FLASH (parallel where hardware allows)
→ Stage 4 VALIDATE (parallel D3+D4+meta-test+coverage) → Stage 5 SWEEP
(parallel HelixQA + Fixed.md migration + README refresh). Stage 1 of
round N+1 overlaps with Stages 4-5 of round N.

**Synchronization:** 4-layer lock hierarchy (parent flock / per-
submodule git / contention-path advisory locks for 10 forbidden cross-
PWU paths / per-PWU worktree). Disjoint-scope PWUs fully parallel.

**Anti-bluff merge-time enforcement (mandatory, all four):** C1
§11.4.43 RED-test captured. C2 §1.1 paired meta-test mutation FAILs
the gate. C3 §11.4.50 3-iter (or 10-iter) deterministic-consistency.
C4 §11.4.5 captured-evidence per feature type. Metadata-only /
configuration-only / absence-of-error / grep-without-runtime PASS
REJECTED. HelixQA Challenge bank coverage MANDATORY for every user-
visible PWU.

**Phase 39.EX infrastructure gates (5 gates land the parallel
infrastructure itself):** `CM-PWU-PARALLEL-VALIDATION-ORCHESTRATOR`,
`CM-PWU-HELIXQA-PER-DOMAIN-RUNNER`, `CM-PWU-WORKER-POOL-LOCKING`,
`CM-PWU-FILE-SCOPE-PARTITION`, `CM-PWU-AUTO-MERGE-GATE-6CONDITIONS`.
Each ships a paired meta-test mutation per §1.1.

Every Markdown document inside the project that is NOT part of an

`docs/**/*.md`, `scripts/**/*.md` (doc-format companion docs),
owned-submodule top-level README.md / CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md /
CHANGELOG.md and their `docs/**/*.md`, `constitution/**/*.md`,

`prebuilts/**`, `packages/modules/**`, `kernel-5.10/**`, `out/**`,
`build/**`, application/service source-code trees, and third-party
submodules NOT in the owned set. Every edit triggers regeneration
via `scripts/testing/sync_all_markdown_exports.sh` (pandoc HTML +
weasyprint PDF, `timeout 60` per file, capped at 500 candidates).
HTML + PDF mtime MUST be ≥ source `.md` mtime at all times.

**§11.4.66 — Blocker-resolution interactive-clarification mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-19)**

When any task is blocked (operator decision, hardware access,
external authorization, ambiguous scope), the agent MUST: (1)
research what's doable from the agent side without operator input;
(2) calculate minimum-viable operator input; (3) construct 2–4
mutually-exclusive options with one marked "Recommended" and each
stating what the agent does after that answer; (4) present via the
platform's interactive question mechanism (`AskUserQuestion` on
Claude Code) — NEVER free-text "what would you like?" for closed-
set decisions; (5) after the answer, resume work without follow-up
round-trips. Composes with §11.4.6 / §11.4.7 / §11.4.40 / §11.4.41
/ §11.4.42 / §11.4.52. No silent waiting; no bulk-text questions
when interactive options would do.

Pre-build gate `CM-COVENANT-114-66-PROPAGATION` enforces the
anchor literal across the 42-file consumer fleet. Paired meta-
test mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs. No escape hatch —
no `--skip-ask`, `--silent-wait`, `--free-form-only` flag.

**§11.4.67 — Shell-script target-shell-parseability mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-19)**

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim, 2026-05-19):** "any
issue we spot must be fixed, bash scripts as well if they are broken!"
+ "Make sure that this is mandatory rule!"

Every shell script that may be invoked under a target shell other than
the one in its shebang MUST parse cleanly under that target shell.
Forensic incident: `device/rockchip/rk3588/tests/test_all_fixes.sh:114`
used bash-only `exec > >(tee -a "$f") 2>&1` on a `sh script.sh` callsite
— Android mksh parses the whole script BEFORE executing, so the runtime
`[ -n "${BASH_VERSION:-}" ]` guard could not save it. Fixed by wrapping
in `eval 'exec > >(tee …) 2>&1'` so the parser sees only a string.

Closed-set scope: every tracked `.sh` under `device/rockchip/rk3588/tests/`,
`scripts/`, `scripts/testing/` (and equivalent paths in owned submodules).
OUT of scope: `external/`, `prebuilts/`, `packages/modules/`, `kernel-5.10/`,
`out/`, `build/`, `scripts/legacy/`. Mandatory invariants: (1) every
in-scope script parses under `sh -n`; (2) bash-only constructs
(`>(...)`, `<(...)`, `[[ ]]`, `<<<`, arrays, `${var^^}`, etc.) MUST be
wrapped in `eval` OR guarded by bash-only loading; (3) shebangs honest
— `#!/bin/bash` only if bash actually expected; (4) fix at source per
§11.4.1, never at callsites. Composes with §11.4.1 / §11.4.4 / §11.4.6
/ §11.4.50 / §11.4.51.

Pre-build gate `CM-SCRIPT-TARGET-SHELL-PARSEABLE` runs `sh -n` on every
in-scope script. Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-67-PROPAGATION`
enforces the anchor literal across the 44-file consumer fleet. Paired
mutations: inject bash-only outside `eval` → parse gate FAILs; strip
`11.4.67` literal → propagation gate FAILs. No escape hatch — no
`--skip-parseability-check`, `--bash-only-script`, `--runtime-guard-suffices`

**§11.4.69 — Universal sink-side positive-evidence taxonomy + mechanical enforcement (User mandate, 2026-05-20)**

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim, 2026-05-20):**

> "THIS MUST HAPPEN NEVER AGAIN!!! We MUST HAVE this all working!
> Not just for audio but for every single piece of the System!!!
> Proper full automation when executed with success MUST MEAN that
> manual testing will be as much positive at least regarding the
> success results! ... Solution MUST BE universal, generic that
> solves working flows for all System components and for all
> future and all existing projects! ... Everything we do MUST BE
> validated and verified with rock-solid proofs and anti-bluff
> policy enforcement and fulfillment!"

Universal generalisation of §11.4.68 (audio-specific) across every
user-visible feature class. Closes the PASS-bluff pattern where
tests reported green while end users hit broken features
(2026-05-19→20 D3 audio "82/84 PASS" + empty Arvus Codec-In-Use).

**The mandate.** Every user-visible feature MUST map to one entry
in the closed-set §11.4.69 sink-side evidence taxonomy (audio_output,
audio_input, video_display, network_throughput, network_connectivity,
bluetooth_a2dp, bluetooth_pair, touch_input, sensor, gpu_render,
storage_read, storage_write, mediacodec_decode, mediacodec_encode,
miracast, cast, boot_service, package_install, permission_grant,
wifi_link, wifi_throughput, ethernet_link, display_topology,
drm_playback, subtitle_render — open to additions). Every PASS for
a feature in the taxonomy MUST cite a captured-evidence artefact
path matching the required evidence shape.

**Helper contracts (additive during grace; mandatory after
2026-06-19):**

- `ab_pass_with_evidence <description> <evidence_path>` — the new
  canonical PASS helper. Verifies path exists AND non-empty;
  emits `PASS: <description> [evidence: <path>]`.
- `ab_skip_with_reason <description> <closed-set-reason>` — reasons:
  `geo_restricted`, `operator_attended`, `hardware_not_present`,
  `topology_unsupported`, `network_unreachable_external`,
  `feature_disabled_by_config`. Forbids
  `network_unreachable_external` for any taxonomy feature with a
  sink-side probe.
- Bare `ab_pass` deprecated — WARN pre-grace, FAIL post-grace
  (2026-06-19).

**Mechanical enforcement.** Three pre-build gates +
three paired §1.1 meta-test mutations:

- `CM-SINK-EVIDENCE-PER-FEATURE` — walks tests for
  `# §11.4.69 FEATURE: <class>` annotation + verifies
  taxonomy probe + `ab_pass_with_evidence` use.
- `CM-NO-FAIL-OPEN-SKIP` — audits sink-side probe helpers;
  FAILs if any code path converts empty/unreachable response to
  PASS-counting SKIP for a feature class with a sink-side probe.
- `CM-AB-PASS-WITH-EVIDENCE-EVERYWHERE` — pre-grace WARN, post-
  grace FAIL on bare `ab_pass` calls.

**Composes with** §11.4.1 (FAIL-bluffs forbidden), §11.4.2
(recorded-evidence), §11.4.5 (audio + video 5-layer quality),
§11.4.6 (no-guessing), §11.4.13 (sink-side captured-evidence),
§11.4.27 (no-fakes-beyond-unit), §11.4.50 (deterministic
consistency), §11.4.52 (autonomous-validation), §11.4.68
(audio-specific sink-side — §11.4.69 is the universal
generalisation).

**No escape hatch** — no `--skip-evidence`, `--config-only-pass`,
`--allow-fail-open-skip`, `--legacy-ab-pass-permitted` flag. The
discipline exists because the 2026-05-20 forensic incident
demonstrated the failure: tests reported audio-routing PASS while
the user heard nothing and the Arvus Codec-In-Use field was empty.

Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-69-PROPAGATION` enforces this
anchor literal across the ~44-file consumer fleet. Paired mutation
strips the literal → gate FAILs.

**§11.4.85 — Stress + Chaos Test Mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-24)**

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim, 2026-05-24):**

> "Every fix or improvement you do MUST BE covered with full automation stress and chaos tests so we are sure nothing can break the functionality and all edge cases are monitored and polished and additionally fixed if that is needed! Everything must produce rock solid proofs and follow fully no-bluff policy!"

Every fix or improvement landed in this project MUST ship with full-automation **stress** AND **chaos** test suites that exercise edge cases, sustained load, concurrent contention, and failure-injection. Happy-path coverage alone is a §11.4 / §107 PASS-bluff at the resilience layer.

**Stress** (closed-set, mechanically auditable): sustained load (N ≥ 100 iterations OR ≥ 30 s wall-clock; per-iteration latency p50/p95/p99 recorded) + concurrent contention (N ≥ 10 parallel invocations; no deadlock, no resource leak) + boundary conditions (empty / max / off-by-one input; every boundary produces a categorised result, never an uncaught exception).

**Chaos** (closed-set, applied per fix-class appropriateness): process-death injection (kill primary or upstream mid-call; categorised recovery) + network-fault injection (drop/delay/reorder; `category=network|upstream` per §11.4.69) + input-corruption injection (corrupt .env / config / input file mid-test; detected + reported) + resource-exhaustion injection (disk full, OOM, FD exhaustion; refuse cleanly OR degrade gracefully — NEVER crash) + state-corruption injection (mid-flight lock loss, partial-write fault; recovery restores consistent state).

Anti-bluff (mandatory). Every stress + chaos test PASS cites a captured-evidence artefact path per §11.4.5 + §11.4.69 (per-iteration `latency.json`, `categorised_errors.txt`, `state_delta_snapshot.json`, `recovery_trace.log`). Helper library `stress_chaos.sh` provides `ab_stress_run`, `ab_stress_concurrent`, `ab_chaos_kill_pid_during`, `ab_chaos_drop_network_during`, `ab_chaos_corrupt_file_during`, `ab_chaos_oom_pressure_during`, `ab_chaos_disk_full_during`, each composing with `ab_pass_with_evidence` / `ab_skip_with_reason`. Chaos-injection cleanup is non-negotiable — corrupt-restore, disk-fill-cleanup, process-restart MUST run in `trap '...' EXIT`; cleanup failure = §11.4.14 violation.

4-layer coverage per §11.4.4(b): pre-build gate (stress + chaos test files exist + executable + parseable under sh -n + bash -n per §11.4.67; helper library exists; the fix's pre-build gate cites the stress + chaos test file path) + paired meta-test mutation per §1.1 (stripping chaos-injection or per-iteration evidence capture → gate FAILs) + on-device test (if LIVE_ADB_TESTABLE per §11.4.51, dispatched against real device, evidence under `qa-results/<run-id>/stress_chaos/`) + HelixQA Challenge entry (if user-visible feature per §11.4.4(b) layer 4).

Composes with §11.4 / §107 (resilience IS end-user quality), §11.4.1 (FAIL-bluffs forbidden), §11.4.5 (captured-evidence quality applies to latency distribution + error categories), §11.4.6 (no guessing — categorised errors only), §11.4.43 (TDD RED-first under load/chaos), §11.4.50 (N iterations identical exit + identical evidence-hashes), §11.4.52 (autonomous validation), §11.4.69 (universal sink-side positive-evidence taxonomy), §11.4.83 (recovery transcripts ARE end-user-channel proofs).

**§11.4.87 — Endless-loop autonomous work + zero-idle agent dispatch + anti-bluff testing mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-26)**

When operator instructs an AI agent to "continue in endless loop fully autonomously" (or semantically-equivalent), the agent MUST treat as HARD-CONTRACT covenant covering five obligations: (A) continue until `docs/Issues.md` non-terminal Status entries = 0 AND `docs/CONTINUATION.md` §3 Active work empty AND no subagent in-flight AND no external dep in-flight; (B) dispatch background subagents for parallelisable work — main + subagents concurrent, "waiting for results" is the ONLY idle reason; (C) every closure lands four-layer test coverage per §11.4.4(b) with captured-evidence "physical proofs" (tinycap WAV + RMS / screen recording + ffprobe / dumpsys + sink-probe / uiautomator dump / sysfs snapshots) — metadata-only / config-only / absence-of-error / grep-without-runtime PASS are critical defects; (D) §11.4 anti-bluff covenant family operative end-to-end (tests AND HelixQA Challenges bound equally per forensic anchor "tests pass but features don't work"); (E) loop terminates ONLY on all-conditions-met, explicit operator STOP, host-safety demand (§12 family), or scheduled wake on known-future-actionable signal.

Composes with §11.4 / §11.4.1 / §11.4.2 / §11.4.4 / §11.4.5 / §11.4.6 / §11.4.7 / §11.4.20 / §11.4.27 / §11.4.42 / §11.4.43 / §11.4.50 / §11.4.52 / §11.4.58 / §11.4.68 / §11.4.69 / §11.4.70 / §11.4.83 / §11.4.85 / §11.4.86 / §12.10.

**§11.4.101 — Autonomous-decision-over-blocking mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-28)**

**Forensic anchor — verbatim user mandate (2026-05-28):** "when working in endless working loop fully autonomously try to decide most properly about points which would block execution and wait for us. If we haven't answered now work would be blocked whole night! If possible and if that will not cause any issues make proper and most reliable and safe decision so we achieve maximal efficiency and work gets fully done!"

When operating in autonomous / endless-loop mode (per §11.4.87), the agent MUST minimize operator-blocking and instead make the safe, reliable, reversible decision itself — so work is NOT stalled (e.g. overnight) waiting for input. §11.4.87 says keep working; §11.4.101 says HOW to clear the decision points that would otherwise force a stop-and-wait.

**Decision rule (closed-set — proceed autonomously when ALL hold):** (a) the action is reversible OR has a captured pre-op backup per §9.2; (b) the agent can determine the safe choice from captured evidence per §11.4.6 (no guessing — `LIKELY` is not a determination); (c) a wrong choice's blast radius is bounded AND recoverable; (d) it composes with anti-bluff §11.4, host-safety §12, data-safety §9.

**Block-only-when rule (BLOCK via §11.4.66 ONLY when ALL hold):** the action is irreversible AND high-blast-radius AND the safe choice cannot be determined from evidence — e.g. external-account state the agent cannot inspect, hardware it cannot access, destructive ops without backup, force-push (also §9.2 + §11.4.41), spending / sending to third parties. `Operator-blocked` per §11.4.21 is reached only after this rule fires AND the self-resolution-exhaustion audit completes.

**Maximize-progress-while-blocked:** an unavoidable block parks one work unit, it does not pause the loop — the agent MUST keep progressing every NON-blocked item in parallel per §11.4.87 + §11.4.94. Posing the question and going idle is a §11.4.94 + §11.4.97 violation.

Composes with §11.4.6 / §11.4.21 / §11.4.40 / §11.4.41 / §11.4.66 / §11.4.87 / §11.4.94 / §9.2 / §12. Classification: universal (§11.4.17). Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-101-PROPAGATION` enforces the literal anchor `11.4.101` across the consumer fleet; paired §1.1 meta-test mutation strips the literal → gate FAILs (gate-code = separate work item).

**Forensic anchor — verbatim user mandate (2026-05-28):** "Make sure we have full automation testing of all scenarios with real bot, main group and users without any manual intervention or contribution of real user! Everything MUST BE fully automatic and autonomous! These tests MUST BE able to rerun endless times when needed! ... Make sure there is no false positives in testing!

A live/integration/e2e/Challenge test requiring a human action during execution (typing a chat message, clicking a UI, hand-triggering a webhook, anything beyond test start + PASS/FAIL report) is **by definition a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the automation layer**, regardless of how thorough the manual run is — cannot run continuously in CI, cannot validate regressions between manual runs, human dependency masks drift.

(A) Binding rule: every test this Constitution governs — unit/integration/e2e/Challenge/stress/chaos/live — MUST be fully self-driving end-to-end; reports PASS/FAIL/SKIP-with-reason without any further human action after startup. (B) Single permissible exception: one-time credential bootstrap OUTSIDE test execution (`.env` from vault, shell exports in `~/.bashrc`, OAuth approval at first install, MTProto session activation at first run) — configuration, not test driving. (C) Concrete requirements for live messenger/channel/agent tests: (1) no "operator MUST type a message" prompts — drive programmatically (MTProto for Telegram, real-user-token API for Slack, IMAP-test-account for email, webhook fixture, in-process loopback — never human keystrokes); (2) no hard-coded session UUIDs that collide with active dev session (Herald 2026-05-28 lesson: `claude --resume <UUID>` on same UUID as dev session returns silent exit -1); (3) no 60s human-response windows (§11.4.50 determinism violation); (4) re-runnability proof — PASS at `-count=3` consecutive automated invocations with self-cleaning state; (5) §11.4.98 obsolescence audit — every existing test classified COMPLIANT vs NON-COMPLIANT; (6) no false-positive PASS — silent-skip-reported-as-PASS forbidden, stale-evidence forbidden, SKIP-with-reason per §11.4.3 is correct. (D) Composes with §11.4.85 + §11.4.89 + §11.4.87 + §11.4.94 — together = continuously-validated, fully-automated, non-flake, anti-bluff regime. (E) Inheritance per §11.4.35 — every consuming repo's CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/QWEN.md restates citing literal anchor `11.4.98`; pre-build gate `CM-COVENANT-114-98-PROPAGATION` enforces literal presence; paired §1.1 mutations strip → gates FAIL. (F) Enforcement: commit adding manual-action test BLOCKED at release-gate; manual-dependency test not rewritten within 30 days graduates to §11.4.90 Obsolete citing §11.4.98 as obsolescence reason.
