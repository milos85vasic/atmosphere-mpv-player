## INHERITED FROM constitution/QWEN.md

All rules in `constitution/QWEN.md` (and the `constitution/Constitution.md`
it references) apply unconditionally. This module's rules below extend them —
they do NOT weaken any universal clause. When this file disagrees with the
constitution submodule, the constitution wins. Locate the constitution
submodule from any arbitrary nested depth using its `find_constitution.sh`
helper.

The universal anti-bluff covenant (§11.4), no-guessing mandate (§11.4.6),
credentials-handling mandate (§11.4.10), host-session safety (§12 + §12.6 +
§12.10), and data safety (§9) all live in `constitution/Constitution.md`.
Read it before working on any non-trivial change.

## How this file relates to CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md

Per §11.4.35 canonical-root inheritance clarity:

- `constitution/QWEN.md` is the universal canonical root for the Qwen Code CLI.
- This file is the consumer-side extension for this submodule, carrying only
  the inheritance pointer + the §11.4 covenant anchors + a brief module summary.
- The full module ruleset lives in this submodule's sibling `CLAUDE.md`.
  Qwen Code agents MUST read CLAUDE.md before performing any work; this
  QWEN.md is the Qwen-specific entry point that ensures Qwen reads the
  inheritance pointer + anti-bluff covenant on every session.

## Module summary

MPV media player for Android, integrated into ATMOSphere firmware on Orange Pi 5 Max (RK3588). Provides high-quality video and audio playback via libmpv with FFmpeg backend.

For full module context (build steps, integration points, host-session safety,
submodule-specific commit/push discipline) read this directory's `CLAUDE.md`
and `AGENTS.md`.

## MANDATORY ANTI-BLUFF COVENANT — END-USER QUALITY GUARANTEE (User mandate, 2026-04-28)

**Forensic anchor — direct user mandate (verbatim):**

> "We had been in position that all tests do execute with success and all
> Challenges as well, but in reality the most of the features does not work
> and can't be used! This MUST NOT be the case and execution of tests and
> Challenges MUST guarantee the quality, the completion and full usability
> by end users of the product!"

This is the historical origin of the project's anti-bluff covenant. Every
test, every Challenge, every gate, every mutation pair exists to make the
failure mode (PASS on broken-for-end-user feature) mechanically impossible.

**Operative rule:** the bar for shipping is **not** "tests pass" but
**"users can use the feature."** Every PASS in this codebase MUST carry
positive evidence captured during execution that the feature works for the
end user. Metadata-only PASS, configuration-only PASS, "absence-of-error"
PASS, and grep-based PASS without runtime evidence are all critical defects
regardless of how green the summary line looks.

**Tests AND Challenges (HelixQA) are bound equally** — a Challenge that
scores PASS on a non-functional feature is the same class of defect as a
unit test that does. Both must produce positive end-user evidence; both
are subject to the §8.1 five-constraint rule and §11 captured-evidence
requirement.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule
[`Constitution.md`](../../../../constitution/Constitution.md) §11.4 (this
end-user-quality-guarantee forensic anchor — propagation requirement
enforced by pre-build gate `CM-COVENANT-114-QWEN-PROPAGATION`).

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

## §11.4 extension anchors carried by this file

The following extension anchors apply unconditionally to every change
landed in this submodule. Their full text lives in the sibling CLAUDE.md
and in the canonical `constitution/Constitution.md`. Listed here so Qwen
Code agents can locate them by literal string match:

- **§11.4.1 extension (Phase 33, 2026-05-05)** — FAIL-bluffs equally
  forbidden. A test that crashes for a script-internal reason and produces
  a FAIL exit code is just as misleading as a PASS-bluff. Fix at source
  layer, never at call sites.
- **§11.4.2 extension (Phase 34, 2026-05-06)** — Recorded-evidence
  requirement. Every PASS for a user-visible feature MUST be cross-checked
  by the analyzer against the dual-display recording + action timeline.
- **§11.4.3 extension (Phase 34, 2026-05-06)** — Per-device-topology test
  dispatch. Topology-touching tests MUST detect topology at entry and
  dispatch the topology-appropriate variant.
- **§11.4.4 extension (User mandate, 2026-05-06)** —
  Test-interrupt-on-discovery + retest-from-clean-baseline. The moment any
  defect is re-discovered or newly identified mid-cycle, STOP and fix at
  root cause + four-layer coverage + full rebuild + reflash + retest.
- **§11.4.4 expansion (User mandate, 2026-05-06)** — Systematic debugging
  via superpowers skills + four-layer test coverage per fix (pre-build
  gate + post-build gate + post-flash on-device test + HelixQA Challenge +
  paired mutation) + documentation update + no-bluff certification per
  cycle.
- **§11.4.5 — Audio + video quality analysis comprehensiveness (User mandate, 2026-05-07)** —
  Audio: presence + channel count + sample rate + glitch census +
  coexistence-artifact census. Video: presence + routing target + frame
  health + obstruction census + resolution + codec. Challenges bound equally.
- **§11.4.6 — No-guessing mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-08)** —
  Forbidden vocabulary: `likely`, `probably`, `maybe`, `might`,
  `possibly`, `presumably`, `seems`, `appears to`. Prove with
  captured evidence OR mark `UNCONFIRMED:` / `UNKNOWN:` /
  `PENDING_FORENSICS:`.
- **§11.4.7 — Demotion-evidence rule (Phase 38.X+2 amendment, 2026-05-11)** —
  Demotion from FAIL to lower-severity requires positive evidence captured
  under the same conditions that originally exposed the defect.
- **§11.4.8 — Deep-web-research-before-implementation mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-12)** —
  Cite external source URL OR literal "NO external solution found — original
  work" in every non-trivial fix.
- **§11.4.9 — Batch-source-fixes-before-rebuild mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-12)** —
  All source-side fixes that DO NOT require runtime on-device validation
  MUST be landed BEFORE the next firmware rebuild.
- **§11.4.10 — Credentials-handling mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-12)** —
  Credentials NEVER live in tracked files. `.env` git-ignored project-wide.
  Tests load from `scripts/testing/secrets/` (chmod 600).
- **§11.4.13 — Out-of-band sink-side captured-evidence mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-13)** —
  When an HDMI sink with network-accessible introspection API is present,
  every audio test MUST consume the sink's report as captured-evidence.
- **§11.4.14 — Test playback cleanup mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-13)** —
  Every test that issues `am start` / `cmd media_session play` MUST
  issue matching `am force-stop` / `KEYCODE_MEDIA_STOP` + EXIT trap.
- **§11.4.15 — Item-status tracking mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-13)** —
  Every active item in `Issues.md` carries a `**Status:**` line.
- **§11.4.16 — Item-type tracking mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-14)** —
  Every active item in `Issues.md` carries a `**Type:**` line with one
  of `{Bug | Feature | Task}`.
- **§11.4.40 — Full-suite retest before release tag mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-17)** —
  Release tag MUST NOT be created until a complete retest with ALL existing
  tests has been executed on a clean baseline.
- **§11.4.41 — Pre-Force-Push Merge-First Mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-17)** —
  Every force-push MUST be preceded by a mechanical 4-step merge-first
  pipeline (fetch + integrate + audit + push with `--force-with-lease`).

## MANDATORY §12.6 MEMORY-BUDGET CEILING — 60% MAXIMUM (User mandate, 2026-04-30)

Project procedures MUST NOT use more than **60% of total system RAM**
(`HOST_SAFETY_MAX_MEM_PCT`). The remaining 40% is reserved for the
operator's other workloads. There is NO operator-facing override flag.

`scripts/build.sh` wraps `m -j` in `bounded_run` so only the
bounded scope is OOM-killed if the build's collective RSS exceeds the
budget — `user@<uid>.service` stays alive.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule
[`Constitution.md`](../../../../constitution/Constitution.md) §12.6.

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

**§11.4.101 — Autonomous-decision-over-blocking (User mandate, 2026-05-28)**

Forensic: "when working in endless working loop fully autonomously try to decide most properly about points which would block execution and wait for us. If we haven't answered now work would be blocked whole night! If possible and if that will not cause any issues make proper and most reliable and safe decision so we achieve maximal efficiency and work gets fully done!"

In autonomous / endless-loop mode (per §11.4.87) the agent MUST minimize operator-blocking and make the safe, reliable, reversible decision itself — work NOT stalled overnight waiting for input. §11.4.87 = keep working; §11.4.101 = HOW to clear the decision points.

Decision rule (proceed autonomously when ALL): (a) reversible OR pre-op backup per §9.2; (b) safe choice determinable from captured evidence per §11.4.6 (`LIKELY` ≠ determination); (c) wrong-choice blast radius bounded AND recoverable; (d) composes with §11.4 + §12 + §9. Block-only-when (BLOCK via §11.4.66 ONLY when ALL): irreversible AND high-blast-radius AND choice undeterminable from evidence — external-account state, inaccessible hardware, destructive-op-without-backup, force-push (§9.2 + §11.4.41), spending / third-party send. `Operator-blocked` per §11.4.21 only after this fires + self-resolution-exhaustion audit. Maximize-progress-while-blocked: a block parks one work unit, not the loop — keep progressing NON-blocked items per §11.4.87 + §11.4.94; pose-and-idle = §11.4.94 + §11.4.97 violation. Composes §11.4.6/21/40/41/66/87/94/§9.2/§12. Classification: universal (§11.4.17). Propagation gate `CM-COVENANT-114-101-PROPAGATION` (literal `11.4.101`) + paired §1.1 mutation (gate-code = separate work item).

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule
[`Constitution.md`](../../../../constitution/Constitution.md) §11.4.101.

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.
**§11.4.52 — Autonomous-Validation Mandate (User mandate, 2026-05-18)**

Every user-facing feature MUST have at least one autonomous validation path: end-to-end via `adb shell` + scripted automation, captured runtime evidence per §11.4.5, PASS/FAIL verdict WITHOUT human presence to drive UI, observe screen, or make decisions. Operator-attended tests are SUPPLEMENTARY, never PRIMARY. A feature whose ONLY validation path is operator-attended is a §11.4.52 violation. Acceptable autonomous paths: (a) programmatic instrumentation APK + structured JSON result; (b) headless intent dispatch + state poll (`am start --es` / `am broadcast` + `dumpsys` / `/proc/<pid>/maps` / `media.metrics`); (c) ADB-driven uiautomator (ONLY if hierarchy has ≥1 clickable node — empty hierarchy demands fallback to APK/intent); (d) network-side sink probe per §11.4.13; (e) HelixQA autonomous QA session per §11.4.27. Coverage ledger (§11.4.25) classifies each feature `AUTONOMOUS_VERIFIED` / `AUTONOMOUS_DESIGNED` / `OPERATOR_ATTENDED_ONLY` / `NOT_APPLICABLE`; `OPERATOR_ATTENDED_ONLY` blocks release until migrated. Composes §11.4.25/27/39/43/48/49/50/51. Pre-build gates `CM-COVENANT-114-52-PROPAGATION` + `CM-AF-AUTONOMOUS-PATH-PER-FEATURE` + paired mutations. No escape hatch.

**Canonical authority:** constitution submodule
[`Constitution.md`](../../../../constitution/Constitution.md) §11.4.52.

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

**§11.4.69 — Universal sink-side positive-evidence taxonomy + mechanical enforcement (User mandate, 2026-05-20)**

Universal generalisation of §11.4.68 (audio-specific) across every user-visible feature class. Every user-visible feature MUST map to one entry in the closed-set §11.4.69 sink-side evidence taxonomy (audio_output, audio_input, video_display, network_throughput, network_connectivity, bluetooth_a2dp, bluetooth_pair, touch_input, sensor, gpu_render, storage_read, storage_write, mediacodec_decode, mediacodec_encode, miracast, cast, boot_service, package_install, permission_grant, wifi_link, wifi_throughput, ethernet_link, display_topology, drm_playback, subtitle_render — open to additions). Every PASS for a feature in the taxonomy MUST cite a captured-evidence artefact path matching the required evidence shape. Helper contracts: `ab_pass_with_evidence <description> <evidence_path>` (verifies path exists AND non-empty); `ab_skip_with_reason <description> <closed-set-reason>` (`geo_restricted` / `operator_attended` / `hardware_not_present` / `topology_unsupported` / `network_unreachable_external` / `feature_disabled_by_config`); bare `ab_pass` deprecated (WARN pre-grace, FAIL post-grace 2026-06-19). Pre-build gates `CM-SINK-EVIDENCE-PER-FEATURE` + `CM-NO-FAIL-OPEN-SKIP` + `CM-AB-PASS-WITH-EVIDENCE-EVERYWHERE` + `CM-COVENANT-114-69-PROPAGATION` + paired §1.1 mutations. Composes §11.4.1/2/5/6/13/27/50/52/68. No escape hatch — no `--skip-evidence`, `--config-only-pass`, `--allow-fail-open-skip`, `--legacy-ab-pass-permitted` flag.

Non-compliance is a release blocker regardless of context.

**§11.4.98 — Full-Automation Anti-Bluff Mandate — Live tests MUST be re-runnable end-to-end without manual intervention (User mandate, 2026-05-28)**

Forensic: "Make sure we have full automation testing of all scenarios with real bot, main group and users without any manual intervention or contribution of real user! Everything MUST BE fully automatic and autonomous! These tests MUST BE able to rerun endless times when needed! ... no false positives ... No bluff is allowed!" A live/integration/e2e/Challenge test requiring a human action during execution (typing a chat message, clicking a UI, hand-triggering a webhook, anything beyond test start + PASS/FAIL report) is by definition a §11.4 PASS-bluff at the automation layer. (A) Every test — unit/integration/e2e/Challenge/stress/chaos/live — MUST be fully self-driving end-to-end, reporting PASS/FAIL/SKIP-with-reason without further human action after startup. (B) Single exception: one-time credential bootstrap OUTSIDE test execution. (C) Live messenger/channel/agent tests: no operator-typed prompts (drive programmatically), no dev-session-colliding UUIDs, no 60s human-response windows (§11.4.50), re-runnability proof at `-count=3`, obsolescence audit COMPLIANT vs NON-COMPLIANT, no false-positive PASS. (D) Composes §11.4.85 + §11.4.89 + §11.4.87 + §11.4.94. (E) Pre-build gate `CM-COVENANT-114-98-PROPAGATION` enforces literal `11.4.98` presence; paired §1.1 mutations strip → gate FAILs. (F) Manual-dependency test not rewritten within 30 days graduates to §11.4.90 Obsolete citing §11.4.98.
