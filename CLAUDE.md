# CLAUDE.md - ATMOSphere MPV Player

MPV media player for Android, integrated into ATMOSphere firmware on Orange Pi 5 Max (RK3588). Provides high-quality video and audio playback via libmpv with FFmpeg backend.

## Project Overview

- **Package**: `is.xyz.mpv`
- **Language**: Kotlin + C/C++ (libmpv, FFmpeg native)
- **Build**: Gradle (AGP 8.13.2, Kotlin 2.0.21)
- **Repo**: `git@github.com:ATMOSphere1234321/ATMOSphere-MPV-Player.git`
- **Parent repo path**: `device/rockchip/atmosphere/mpv-player`
- **Upstream**: mpv-android (mpv-android/mpv-android)

### Key Directories

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `app/` | Main Android app module |
| `buildscripts/` | Native library build scripts (libmpv, FFmpeg, etc.) |

### ATMOSphere Integration

- Listed in `VIDEO_PACKAGES` in VideoPlaybackDetector for Tier 2 task-move detection
- Uses libmpv native player (not Android MediaCodec) -- bypasses MediaCodec.configure() hook entirely
- Tier 2 video routing: VPD detects MediaSession PLAYING, waits 3s for Tier 1, then `am display move-stack` to secondary display
- DEFLATED native libs (libmpv, FFmpeg, libc++_shared) injected into system.img via debugfs_static pipeline
- Added to PRODUCT_PACKAGES and APK_LIB_MAP in Fix #110

## MANDATORY ANTI-BLUFF VALIDATION (Constitution §8.1 + §11)

**This submodule inherits the parent ATMOSphere project's anti-bluff covenant.
A test that PASSes while the feature it claims to validate is unusable to an
end user is the single most damaging failure mode in this codebase. It has
shipped working-on-paper / broken-on-device builds before, and that MUST NOT
happen again.**

The canonical authority is `docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md` §8.1
("NO BLUFF — positive-evidence-only validation") and §11 ("Bleeding-edge
ultra-perfection") in the parent repo. Every contribution to THIS submodule
is bound by it. Summarised non-negotiables:

1. **Tests MUST validate user-visible behaviour, not just metadata.** A gate
   that greps for a string in a config XML, an XML attribute, a manifest
   entry, or a build-time symbol is METADATA — not evidence the feature
   works for the end user. Such a gate is allowed ONLY when paired with a
   runtime / on-device test that exercises the user-visible path and reads
   POSITIVE EVIDENCE that the behaviour actually occurred (kernel `/proc/*`
   runtime state, captured audio/video, dumpsys output produced *during*
   playback, real input-event delivery, real surface composition, etc).
2. **PASS / FAIL / SKIP must be mechanically distinguishable.** SKIP is for
   environment limitations (no HDMI sink, no USB mic, geo-restricted endpoint
   unreachable) and MUST always carry an explicit reason. PASS is reserved
   for cases where positive evidence was observed. A test that completes
   without observing evidence MUST NOT report PASS.
3. **Every gate MUST have a paired mutation test in
   `scripts/testing/meta_test_false_positive_proof.sh` (parent repo).** The
   mutation deliberately breaks the feature and the gate MUST then FAIL.
   A gate without a paired mutation is a BLUFF gate and is a Constitution
   violation regardless of how many checks it appears to make.
4. **Challenges (HelixQA) and tests are in the same boat.** A Challenge that
   reports "completed" by checking the test runner exited 0, without
   observing the system behaviour the Challenge is supposed to verify, is a
   bluff. Challenge runners MUST cross-reference real device telemetry
   (logcat, captured frames, network probes, kernel state) to confirm the
   user-visible promise was kept.
5. **The bar for shipping is not "tests pass" but "users can use the feature."**
   If the on-device experience does not match what the test claims, the test
   is the bug. Fix the test (positive-evidence harder), do not silence it.
6. **No false-success results are tolerable.** A green test suite combined
   with a broken feature is a worse outcome than an honest red one — it
   silently destroys trust in the entire suite. Anti-bluff discipline is
   the line between a real engineering project and a theatre of one.

When in doubt: capture runtime evidence, attach it to the test result, and
let a hostile reviewer (i.e. yourself, in six months) try to disprove that
the feature really worked. If they can, the test is bluff and must be hardened.

parent AGENTS.md "NO BLUFF" section, parent `scripts/testing/meta_test_false_positive_proof.sh`.

## MANDATORY DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

1. **Solutions MUST NOT be error-prone** -- every fix must be robust, not introduce new failure modes
2. **No blocking operations inside synchronized blocks** -- Thread.sleep(), network calls, or long computations inside `synchronized` WILL cause deadlocks
3. **Always consider concurrent callers** -- multiple media sessions can be active simultaneously
4. **Test the fix, not just the symptom** -- verify the fix works AND does not break anything else

## MANDATORY API KEY & SECRETS CONSTRAINTS

1. **NEVER commit `.env` files** -- they contain API keys and credentials
2. **NEVER add API keys to source code** -- use environment variables or `.env` files only
3. **ALWAYS verify `.gitignore` protects `.env`** before committing

## MANDATORY COMMIT & PUSH CONSTRAINTS

1. **ONLY use the official commit script from the PARENT repo**: `bash scripts/commit_all.sh "message"`
2. **NEVER use `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push` directly** in this submodule
3. The parent script handles staging, committing, and pushing to ALL remotes

## MANDATORY SUBMODULE SYNC CONSTRAINTS

1. **ALWAYS fetch and pull latest from upstream** before pushing our committed changes
2. **Analyze all new features/APIs** from upstream and incorporate them properly
3. **Merge conflicts** must be resolved carefully -- never discard upstream changes blindly

## MANDATORY TAGGING CONSTRAINTS

1. **Tags are NEVER created before flashing and validating** on BOTH ATMOSphere devices
2. **Tags MUST be applied to ALL owned submodules** when tagging the main repo
3. **Tag naming**: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>-dev[-<sub-version>]`

## Project Context

- Part of ATMOSphere Android 15 firmware for Orange Pi 5 Max (RK3588)
- Parent repo at `/run/media/milosvasic/DATA4TB/Projects/Android_15/` handles build, flash, and test
- Build via parent: `bash scripts/build.sh --skip-pull --skip-tests --skip-ota`
- Tests via parent: `bash device/rockchip/rk3588/tests/pre_build_verification.sh`

## MANDATORY: ATMOSphere Constitution compliance (appended 2026-04-19 — ATMOSphere 1.1.3-dev-0.0.6)

Every change in this submodule MUST comply with the canonical
Constitution at `docs/guides/ATMOSPHERE_CONSTITUTION.md` in the parent
repo. In summary:

1. **Test coverage for every change** — pre-build gate (CM-MC*),
   post-build gate, on-device test, and a mutation entry in
   `scripts/testing/meta_test_false_positive_proof.sh` proving the
   gate catches regressions.
2. **Device validation before any tag** — both D1 and D2 flashed and
   green on every relevant suite.
3. **Commit + push via `bash scripts/commit_all.sh "…"` from the
   parent repo root.** Submodule source changes are committed in the
   submodule itself first, pushed to every remote of that submodule,
   and then the parent's `commit_all.sh` captures the updated
   pointer.
4. **Tags cascade.** Every version tag on the main repo is mirrored
   on this submodule at its current HEAD, across every remote this
   submodule publishes to. Use
   `scripts/testing/release_tag.sh <tag>` from the parent repo.
5. **Changelog discipline.** `docs/changelogs/<tag>.{md,html,json,txt}`
   on the parent repo documents every release; exported via
   `scripts/testing/export_changelog.sh`.
6. **No false-success results.** Tests that are always-PASS are
   immediately rewritten. Meta-test mutations catch bluff gates.
7. **Flock.** `commit_all.sh` and `push_all.sh` are serialised via
   `.git/.commit_all.lock` / `.git/.push_all.lock`. Never bypass.

Non-compliance is a blocker regardless of context.


## MANDATORY ABSOLUTE DATA SAFETY — ZERO RISK (Constitution §9)

**EVERY destructive repository operation** (history rewrite, force-push,
branch deletion, bulk file removal, submodule de-init, object pruning) MUST
follow Constitution §9 without exception:

1. **Hardlinked backup first** — near-instant (`cp -al .git <backup>/repo.git.mirror`),
   zero extra disk. No excuse to skip. Parent-repo helper:
   `scripts/testing/safe_history_rewrite.sh --pre-op`.
2. **Record pre-op metadata** — refs, tags, submodule pointers, HEAD commit,
   HEAD tree hash, HEAD tree content sha256.
3. **Run the operation** — never with hook-bypassing flags unless the user
   has explicitly authorized them for that exact operation.
4. **Post-op gate** — HEAD tree byte-identical (unless explicitly expected
   to change), all tags preserved, all submodule pointers intact, all
   domain-specific integrity checks pass. ANY failure → restore immediately
   from the hardlinked backup.
5. **Force-push is NEVER automatic** — `push_all.sh` (in parent repo) must
   not force-push as a failure-recovery path. Every force-push requires
   explicit per-session human authorization AND a passing §9 post-op gate.
6. **Audit trail** — force-push events recorded in parent repo
   `docs/changelogs/<tag>.md`.

Data-safety violations are catastrophic (irreversible once the remote GCs
dangling objects) and block the release cycle until fully remediated.
